# Lesson1

In the "Try It Yourself" section of this hour, we used the line

alert(document.title);

to output the title property of the document object. Try rewriting that script to instead output the document.lastModified property, which contains the date and time that the web page was last changed. (Be careful--property names are case sensitive. Note the capital M.) See whether you can then modify the code to use document.write() in place of alert(), to write the property directly into the page like Figure 1.3.
